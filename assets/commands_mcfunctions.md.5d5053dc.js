A function pack creates a system using solely function files.</p><p>Functions are useful in many ways to reduce the time spent going from command block to command block debugging a system.

You may start a line with # to add comments. Commands in a function do not need to begin with a slash <code>/</code>, however doing so will not cause any errors.</p><p>All commands in a function are run in the <em>same tick</em>. Because of this, a function which causes large changes may cause a sudden lag spike and it is helpful to delegate some commands across multiple ticks, if possible. Commands in a function are still run in the same order, however.</p><p>It is not possible to run conditional commands. Those will still need to utilize command blocks in some way, or could utilize the 1.19.50 execute syntax.</p><p>Running commands with a specified delay in a function would involve using scoreboard timers to incrementally count up every tick (to a certain point), and executing at certain scores along the file.
