You can create new particle systems in the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft by using your own custom textures, and your own movement logic. This makes particles extremely fun and powerful!</p><p>The MoLang integration in particles is also extremely well developed, which allows you to pass data between different particles, or between an entity and a particle.</p><h3 id="particles" tabindex="-1">Particles <a class="header-anchor" href="#particles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Particles&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A &#39;particle&#39;, or a &#39;particle instance&#39; is a single sprite (texture) which is placed in 3D space, and has its own logic for how to move about and change its appearance.
