To add a texture you will go to the Shading tab in blender. There you are going to add a texture element like this:</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=""><img src="'+g+'" alt=""></p><p>In that element you press open and select your texture in our case it is <code>something\\VRpackTemplate\\textures\\hologram_hands.png</code>. Make sure you change linear to closest, otherwise your texture will look blurry. In the end it will look like this:</p><p><img src="'+_+'" alt=""></p><p>Now its time to add the texture to the models material. You hold the yellow dot and connect it to the other yellow dot like this:</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt=""></p><p>If everything went good your model should now look like this:</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt=""></p><h2 id="editing-the-model" tabindex="-1">Editing the model <a class="header-anchor" href="#editing-the-model" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Editing the model&quot;">​</a></h2><p>With editing the model you have almost total freedom, the only requirement is that the model only uses 1 texture.</p><h3 id="editing-the-model-easy" tabindex="-1">Editing the model (easy) <a class="header-anchor" href="#editing-the-model-easy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Editing the model (easy)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Since this is the easy tutorial, we will show you how to make the hand into an arm.</p><p>First we need to figure out the dimensions of this object.</p><p><img src="'+k+'" alt=""></p><p>This image shows us that 3 pixels is equivalent to 18.75 meters in Blender, an arm is 12 pixels long so this means an arm is <code>4 * 18.75 = 75 meters</code> in Blender. When editing the dimensions it will look like this:</p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt=""></p><p>If we import it into minecraft the arm will be to far away. This is because the original model is made for a hand not an arm. So we need to move it <code>3 * 18.75 = 56.25 meters</code> down.</p><p><img src="'+x+'" alt=""></p><h4 id="texturing" tabindex="-1">Texturing <a class="header-anchor" href="#texturing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Texturing&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Since this is an arm we will use the steve arm model, you import it the same way like we did above.</p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt=""></p><p><img src="'+T+'" alt=""></p><p>Now you might notice your texture is stretched out. to fix this we will go to UV-editing and edit the uv map.
