You may insert numbers after a tilde to add an offset to the current position.

If there is no entity to copy rotation from, the x- and y-rotations are assumed to be 0.</p><p>Examples: - <code>^10 ^ ^</code>: Current position with a 10-block offset to the left. - <code>^ ^1.5 ^1</code>: Current position with a 1.5-block offset upward and a 1-block offset forward.</p><h2 id="additional-notes" tabindex="-1">Additional Notes <a class="header-anchor" href="#additional-notes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Additional Notes&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>The player&#39;s eye level is 1.62 blocks above their feet.
